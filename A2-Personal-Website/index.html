        <h1>Hello, I'm Wallace!</h1>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I'm currently studying at Simon Fraser University in the School of Interactive Arts & Technology (BSc) in Surrey, B.C., with concentrations in Extended Reality & Game Design and Web Design & Development.</p>
        <p>I am game designer with a focus on gameplay & level design. I'm most interested in developing core and secondary mechanics, helping create engaging gameplay loops for players. I've built my experience through several team-based projects creating completed games as a mechanic designer, level designer, and project manager.</p>
        <p>My skillset in programming (Java/Unity) and prototyping tools (Figma) has allowed me to develop, iterate, and test my design decisions in these projects, as I can communicate through both sketches and working prototypes. My skillset also allows me to closely collaborate with designers and programmers, helping bridge the gap between functionality and aesthetics for games.</p>
        <p>Outside of game design, I am also interested in web development, having created websites using HTML, CSS, and PHP. I have been actively expanding my skillset in coding, as I am completing a Certificate in Computing Science at SFU.</p>
